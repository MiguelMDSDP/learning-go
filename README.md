### Quicksort

Quicksort is a classic algorithm to sort a list of numbers. This scripts sorts a list of integers passed in the compiling command line. This script also contains the utilization of logic structures like if and for, how to make functions with one or more returns, slices manipulations and others.

##### Running example

> go run src/quicksort.go 10 50 60 70 35 33 24 107


<a name="initials"></a> 
### Initials

This script count how many words starts with each letter passed in the compiling command line. This script also contains how to use maps.

##### Running example

> go run src/initials.go I am learning how to code with golang and I am enjoying it


<a name="stacks"></a>
### Stacks

In this code, we work on the concept of stacks using the construction of a new type in the Golang, abstracting the concept of object orientation and also creating the first methods for this new type.

##### Running example

> go run src/stacks.go


<a name="iterators"></a>
### Iterators

In the example “iterators” we have the use of different types of for blocks, named or unnamed.

##### Running example

> go run src/iterators.go


<a name="squares"></a>
### Squares

In this example we learn how to work with sorted maps using a squares example.

##### Running example

> go run src/squares.go


<a name="shoppinglist"></a>
### Shopping List

In this script we create new types based on the standard types of GoLang. This code simulates a shopping list to work on this.

##### Running example

> go run src/shopping-list.go


<a name="operations"></a>
### Operations

This code implements a new type and a interface to do calculations of sums and subtractons using polymorphic structure.

##### Running example

> go run src/operations.go


<a name="reader"></a>
### Reader

This example shows how to work with the standard library io.Reader.

##### Running Example

> go run src/reader.go
